# ytmcd
YouTube Music Channel Downloader.

A sensible selection of youtube-dl flags to download music from music channels in bulk!

If you are using this for yourself, feel free to ignore file `downloaded` as that is for my own personal record, and be sure to edit `channels` to your own preferences.


### Remarks

Refer to the man page for my `youtube-dl` flag choices, but here are some points worth mentioning:

* `--download-archive downloaded`: sucessful downloads will have their video ids listed here, which `youtube-dl` will ignore in subsequent runs
* `--geo-bypass`: useful for a lot of the Asian songs (thanks SONY Japan...)
* `--max-filesize 128m`: Usually amounts to 2-3 hour files in ytmcd's case, fits most reasonable-length music mixes and avoids annoying 10-hour novelty videos
* `--add-metadata`: Writes the video's metadata (e.g. title becomes title, channel name becomes artist) to the downloaded audio file

And for some general Q/A (please correct me if I am wrong via issue or PR):

##### Why `-f bestaudio -f m4a` instead of `-x --audio-format mp3 --audio-quality 0`?

See [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/6w37ec/ytmcd_a_sensible_selection_of_youtubedl_flags_to/dm5anr1/) reddit thread. [Here](https://superuser.com/a/846856) is another great explanation.

##### Why no `--restrict-filenames`?

* I download lots of East Asian music and prefer to keep the original titles as filenames
* My terminal can handle unicode
